this whole shindig of having to pay for food is not beneficial to the plants and animals on earth. 

you all need to sew seeds for everything from cinnamon to mairjuana, to mushrooms and teak
and let wild animals loos and just run free

i'm mildly concerned at this point that i don't have regular access to food and a fresh water spring


and no, if you are asking, I do not consider roided out kale food. 

I want my foood to show up wildly wherever i go, because again we are finding that the farming
methods in use, and the lack of marijuana and hemp in the environment, is leading to 
a flop from a raw materials perspective, and a food perspective. 

and we need robots to harvest all of these foods and bring it to us. quadrocopters or like RC cars
with robotic arms are cool. 

but yeah you need to stop 
a) controlling the spread of plants
b)mowing the lawn

or else
we're going to run into some problems. 

limit catching fish, let lion fish takeover if they have to, only allow fishing monday and 
friday. no on in god's name needs to fish every day. 

let the land go and the world go and fish repopluate for the future of mankind. 

this is a mass extiction, but as long as we don't go full retard, it doesn't have to be on the
exact same level as the dinosaurs.
